# Solution Steps

1. Create a new Spring Boot project with Kafka dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-kafka`).

2. Define the 'AuditLog' model to represent audit log entries; use fields like transactionId, fromAccount, toAccount, amount, timestamp.

3. Implement a thread-safe in-memory AuditLogService using CopyOnWriteArrayList to store logs, ensuring concurrency safety.

4. Configure Kafka with Producer and Consumer beans, serialization (JsonSerializer/JsonDeserializer), topic creation, and concurrency tuning.

5. Create a service (TransferService) to handle 'money transfer'. The transfer method should build an AuditLog, send it to Kafka asynchronously (non-blocking), and handle errors in a non-blocking way (CompletableFuture).

6. Implement a Kafka consumer (AuditLogKafkaConsumer) that listens for AuditLog messages, and on receiving, safely adds the entry to the in-memory log. Add error handling to process or skip bad messages but never crash or block the consumer thread.

7. Expose an HTTP POST endpoint (TransferController) to simulate a money transfer, taking sender, receiver, and amount. This should return immediately with a transactionId.

8. Add an HTTP GET endpoint (AuditLogController) to fetch all audit logs currently in memory.

9. Ensure that the application properties include correct Kafka bootstrap-servers and that Kafka is running before testing.

10. Test: Submit transfers using the POST endpoint. Observe that transfer returns immediately, audit entries appear after a short delay in the GET /api/audit-log endpoint, and no lost/duplicate logs occur.
